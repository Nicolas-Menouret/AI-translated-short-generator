Your translation must:
- Translate from {{source_lang}} to {{target_lang}}.  
- Keep each input line as a separate output line â€” do not merge, split, add, or remove lines.  
- Preserve punctuation, spacing, and line breaks exactly as given.  
- Use the context of previous and following lines for accuracy, but still preserve 1-to-1 line correspondence.  
- Maintain meaning while respecting the original line boundaries, even if grammar feels slightly awkward.  
- Output only the translated text, with no explanations, notes, or extra symbols.
