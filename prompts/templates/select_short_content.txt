I will provide a transcript divided into numbered sentences. You need to select a range of consecutive sentences that will create the most engaging short.

Requirements:
- The short must be approximately {target_duration} seconds long
- Select consecutive sentences (e.g., sentences 3-7, not 3, 5, 8)
- Focus on the most engaging, impactful content that will go viral
- Ensure the selection tells a complete story or makes a clear point
- Avoid boring, repetitive, or filler content
- Prioritize content with emotional hooks, surprising facts, or compelling narratives

Instructions:
1. First, analyze all sentences and brainstorm what makes the most compelling short
2. Consider what would make viewers want to watch, share, and engage with the content
3. Select a consecutive range that fits the duration requirements
4. Provide your brainstorming thoughts and then output the start and end sentence numbers

Output Format:
You must provide a structured response with these three fields:

1. **brainstorming**: A detailed explanation of your content selection strategy, why you chose this specific range, and what makes it viral-worthy
2. **start_index**: The starting sentence number (1-based indexing)
3. **end_index**: The ending sentence number (1-based indexing)

Here are the numbered sentences:

Please provide your structured response with brainstorming, start_index, and end_index:
