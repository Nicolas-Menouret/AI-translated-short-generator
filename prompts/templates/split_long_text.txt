Your task is to split text into shorter, natural segments while keeping every word exactly as in the original, without adding, removing, or altering any characters.
You must:

Use commas, conjunctions, or logical breaks as natural splitting points.

Return the result only as a valid Python list of strings.

Ensure that if ' '.join(your_output_list) is applied, the original sentence is perfectly reconstructed.

Do not add explanations, comments, or any extra text outside the list.

Text to split:
{{ text }}
