Your task is to split text into shorter, natural segments while keeping every word exactly as in the original, without adding, removing, or altering any characters.
You must:

Use commas, conjunctions, or logical breaks as natural splitting points.

Return the result as a JSON object with a "segments" key containing a list of strings.

Ensure that if ' '.join(your_output_list) is applied, the original sentence is perfectly reconstructed.

Do not add explanations, comments, or any extra text outside the JSON.

Example format:
{
  "segments": ["first part", "second part", "third part"]
}

Text to split:
{{ text }}
